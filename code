		"description": "Wondering how to always win the Ludo game online? Well, read on to find the answer! We’ve all had some Ludo tricks up our sleeves to win our way through the games we played as kids. We mean, you would agree that praying to our favorite gods didn’t work all the time and we eventually did resort to some sort of cheating. Maybe slyly moving the tokens ahead when no one is watching or rolling the dice again because we didn’t get the number we needed – all of us have done this.
                    All this might have given us an edge over our opponents in the traditional ludo but what about online Ludo? Are there tips and tricks here as well? Well, you can’t really cheat but yes, there are some Ludo tricks that can help you play online better!",

		"description": "Make sure the token that is ahead of all of your other tokens is the safest. In all three ludo games from Zupee, a token earns a point when it moves a box. That being said, the token that has moved the most boxes will have naturally scored the most number of points. An opponent will try their best to cut this particular token as, in doing so, they will ensure that all points you scored on that token are lost. ",

One is a timer that shows the time limit that is defined for every match, and two is a timer that shows you how long before you run out of time to play your turn. Both are important. It can make or break your game. Know when to take longer to think your turn through and when to play in an instant. ",
